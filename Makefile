# Convenience wrapper around the CMake build. The real build system is
# CMakeLists.txt; this Makefile gives you `make`-style targets with a few
# quality-of-life additions (auto-reconfigure when the cache goes stale,
# parallel builds, and a `diag` target that dumps the resolved toolchain).
#
# Usage:
#   make            # configure + build (Release)
#   make test       # build + run ctest
#   make run        # build + launch (default music, 132 bpm)
#   make run-pulse  # launch with the CC0 Wireframe Pulse track
#   make clean      # remove the build/ directory
#   make reconfigure# force a fresh CMake configure (new build dir)
#   make diag       # dump the resolved compiler / SDK / GLFW / SDL2 / openmpt
#   make help       # show this list
#
# Extra CMake flags can be passed as CMAKE_EXTRA, e.g.:
#   make CMAKE_EXTRA=-DIW_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=OFF
#   make reconfigure CMAKE_EXTRA=-DIW_SYSROOT=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)
#
# To build audio in, the toolchain must expose SDL2 + libopenmpt via
# CMake/PkgConfig (brew install sdl2 libopenmpt on macOS;
# apt install libsdl2-dev libopenmpt-dev on Linux; the CI does this).
